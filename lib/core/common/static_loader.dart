/// Loader - A Custom Loading Indicator Widget for Flutter Applications.
///
/// This widget provides a visually appealing and customizable loading indicator,
/// encapsulating the CircularProgressIndicator within a styled container. It's designed
/// to present a consistent loading experience across the application.
///
/// The Loader is center-aligned and features a container with adjustable dimensions
/// and color, based on the current theme context (dark or light). It is ideal for
/// indicating loading or processing states in various parts of the application.
///
/// Design:
///   - The container has a fixed height and width of 120, adjustable using ScreenUtil.
///   - It features rounded corners with a radius of 20.
///   - The background color of the container changes based on the theme brightness:
///     - Light background for dark themes.
///     - Dark background for light themes.
///   - The CircularProgressIndicator is centrally aligned with a distinct yellow color and
///     a stroke width of 6 for clear visibility.
///   - Additional padding is provided below the indicator.
///
/// Usage:
/// Simply add the `Loader` widget to your widget tree where a loading indicator is needed.
/// For example, it can be used in a FutureBuilder while waiting for data or during
/// asynchronous operations.
///
/// ```dart
/// Loader()
/// ```
///
/// Note: This loader is designed for ease of use and consistency. You can modify the size,
/// color, and other properties to better fit your application's design needs.
